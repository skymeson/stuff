Cleaning up disk space 

 
If you get this type of message or you are having trouble saving files, then you may be over your disk space limit. This limit is referred to as your disk quota. You can gain some space by doing a little house cleaning on your account. Check out your account's quota by using the Quota Calculator for a quick look at your file space information. However, for a more detailed analysis of your file space and a way to reduce it, log in to Holly/Simla/Lamar using "telnet" and at the % or $ prompt enter the "quota" command. This command produces output similar to the following: 

Once you know how much space you are using, you can use a few commands to determine which directories and files have all of this space. 
Since you are in your home directory when you log in, the command 

du -sk * |sort -nr |more

will tell you the amount of space used by each directory or file in your home directory. For example, it could produce the following output: 

16368 mail
1332  Hello_from_FHills
1076  Hiya_Sweetie
360   Trash
264   c:creaks
264   c:\creaks
264   a:creaks
24    7-23.DOC
4     dead.letter


This tells you that most of your space is being used in a file or directory called mail. In this case, mail is a directory so you should look in this directory for files to remove or reduce in size. The number 16368 is in blocks which means that this directory is using about 16.368 megabytes of space. Incidentally, mail is the directory that pine uses to store any mail folders you create. 

You also have a number of other files that are taking space including one that is taking 1.332 megabytes and another that is taking 1.076 megabytes. The command "ls -l" will tell you which of these are files and which are directories. You can remove a file with the command: 
rm filename

You can also remove a directory and all its contents with the command: 

 rm -r directoryname


In this case, you should cd into the mail directory and run the du command again to get a break down of the files and directories within the mail directory as follows: 

cd mail

du -sk * |sort -nr |more

This will produce a list something like: 

2380  sent-mail-oct-1998
2112  misc
1756  t
1184  sent-mail-nov-1998
1048  offcampus
968   higher
860   computer
820   sent-mail-aug-1998
524   sent-mail-sep-1998
420   creak
404   sent-mail-dec-1998
376   sent-mail-jan-1999
360   mlk

You can remove any of these files with the "rm" command but since these are mail folders you may want to use pine to read these folders with the "L" command and delete unwanted mail or use the "D" command in pine to delete the whole folder. Good candidates for removal are the sent-mail folders which contain all the mail you have sent out organized by months.
